# Pascal_Triange_FIT1045
- This is a python code. I got HD for this assignment.
- I wrote a recursive program that takes as input a non-negative integer n and prints out the first n + 1 rows of Pascal's triangle.
The triangle will print as a right angle triangle.
For Example: On input n = 0, your program may output:
Number n: 0
1
and on input n = 7, your program may output:
Number n: 7
1
1 1
1 2 1
1 3 3 1
1 4 6 4 1
1 5 10 10 5 1
1 6 15 20 15 6 1
1 7 21 35 35 21 7 1
